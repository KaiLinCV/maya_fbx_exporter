# üì¶ Maya FBX Exporter
This is a Python script with a simple GUI interface that exports selected objects in Autodesk Maya to the `.fbx` format.
I created this tool to make exporting assets to FBX faster and more automated. It allows me to export 3D models with just a few clicks, instead of manually exporting each one individually.
